## ðŸ§­ Usage Guide

1. **Register/Login** to access bidding features.
2. **Create an Auction** (seller): set title, description, start price, start & end time, upload one or more images.
3. **Go Live**: auction automatically becomes live at the start time.
4. **Place Bids** (bidders): highest valid bid wins when time ends.
5. **Closing**: auctions move to *Ended* when the end time passes (via scheduler/cron).
6. **Results**: seller sees winner & final price; winner gets a notification.

> To run schedulers locally, add a cron entry:

```
* * * * * php /path/to/project/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```
